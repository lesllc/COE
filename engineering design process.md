## Overview
To get to the cool stuff skip to the [specification portion](#9-specification) of this document

## Introduction
This project uses an Arduino Uno R3, ADXL335 Accelerometer, and common anode RGB LEDs to mix together the red green blue colors to make a theoretically endless amount of colors.

## Engineering Design Process
The engineering design process is a series of steps that engineers utilize to develop a solution to a problem. This process consists of these steps:

### 1. Identification of the Need
Indentifying the need consists of finding a problem for which a solution is needed. As an engineer, it is common for a person or company to come to you with a problem (in the case of a design firm).

### 2. Definition of the Problem
Define the problem in a broad sense such that a maximum number of solutions are possible. It's important not to limit the possible solutions in this step. The problem must be clearly defined.

### 3. Search
Gather information that will be useful. Any schematics, data sheets, test code, or other information that will aid in the design process.

### 4. Constraints
Constraints are any design considerations that limit the solution. Shape, weight, size, are common constraints.

### 5. Criteria
Criteria are design considerations that are desireable for the final solution to posess. Minimizing cost, "Wow!" factor, ease of use are all criteria.

### 6. Alternative Solutions
The alternative solutions portion of the design process is used to brainstorm ideas for possible solutions. It's best to come up with as many ideas as possible during this step. Even if they don't seem reasonable or immediately seem like nonsense, don't toss them out yet.

### 7. Analysis
Using weighted criteria, compare the possible (alternative) solutions after applying the weighted criteria. Assign a percentage (weight) to each criteria. Then rate each solution with a score on a scale of -2 to 2. After applying the weights to the scores, sum them for each solution individually.

### 8. Decision
Using the analysis of the weighted criteria, select the best possible solution.

### 9. Specification
Formalize and complete the design.

### 10. Communication
Compile the report and any other documentation needed to effectively communicate the design. Make sure everything is documented such that the design can be understood and expanded upon by engineers that may become involved with your work futher down the line.

## Purpose (Need)
This project's purpose was for students to use the [College of Engineering](http://www.astate.edu/college/engineering/) at [Arkansas State University](http://www.astate.edu/) [Engineering Course Standards](http://www.astate.edu/college/engineering/files/EngineeringCourseStandards2014.pdf) and to use the engineering design process. The assigment is based on the premise that the Arduino company has contacted the CoE at A-State to develop an integrated system that demos the power and flexibility of the Arduino platform. It is also a goal to demonstrate the ease of use and creative capabilities of the Arduino platform. "[Wow!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal)" factor was a large portion of this goal as it is the desire of the Arduino company to persuade a person to buy an Arduino.
